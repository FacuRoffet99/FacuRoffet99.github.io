## üî± About me

Hello, I‚Äôm Facu, an electronic engineer who realized I really don‚Äôt like circuits. In a moment of complete serendipity during the pandemic, I came across the YouTube channel [DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/@DotCSV) and almost instantly discovered that my true passion was artificial intelligence (particularly deep learning). So I decided to start learning about it on my own (I can‚Äôt recommend the [FastAI course](https://course.fast.ai/) enough).

Fortunately for my career, the National University of the South (Universidad Nacional del Sur - UNS) has the Image Science Laboratory (Laboratorio de Ciencias de las Im√°genes - LCI), a nationally renowned institution for research, development, and technology transfer in image processing and remote sensing. There I met [Claudio Delrieux](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AdhE2GoAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) (LCI director), who quickly became my mentor and introduced me to [Gustavo Patow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w2kGazcAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao). The three of us outlined a work plan for me to apply for a CONICET doctoral fellowship. Since then, I have specialized in using deep learning and brain fMRI data to improve early diagnosis and understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

Beyond my work, I have random interests in other disciplines such as philosophy, geography, and psychology. I‚Äôm a strong advocate of learning for its own sake, not just as a means to an end, so I spend part of my free time watching online courses and taking notes. My notes are primarily designed for my own understanding, but I make them available in the [Course Notes](/en/notes/) section in case they‚Äôre helpful to anyone else.

## üîç Academic projects and publications

**Doctoral project (April 2023 ‚Äì Present):**
Study and development of deep learning‚Äìbased tools for simulating and predicting whole-brain neuronal activity and its evolution in disease states by defining biomarkers. The goal is for these tools to predict treatment effects and drug responses in neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs, etc.) to contribute to personalized diagnosis.

* Deep Learning and Whole-Brain Networks for Biomarker Discovery: Modeling the Dynamics of Brain Fluctuations in Resting-State and Cognitive Tasks. *Preprint on arXiv*, 2024. [LINK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19329)

**MultiCaRe Project (January 2024 ‚Äì Present):**
Use of hierarchical ontologies and semi-supervised learning techniques to improve both label quality and data structuring in a medical image dataset of over 150,000 samples across 140 hierarchical categories.

* An Open-Source Clinical Case Dataset for Medical Image Classification and Multimodal AI Applications. *Under Review*, 2025
* The Multiplex Classification Framework: Optimizing Multi-Label Classifiers through Problem Transformation, Ontology Engineering, and Model Ensembling. *Preprint on arXiv (accepted, publication pending in Applied Ontology)*, 2024. [LINK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14299)

**Erythrocyte project (October 2022 ‚Äì June 2024):**
Design of a methodology to automatically detect five anomalies in avian red blood cells using an imbalanced dataset to enable rapid, less subjective analysis (F1 score: 0.7703).

**Undergraduate thesis (September 2021 ‚Äì August 2022):**
Use of information theory to evaluate fMRI harmonization techniques, finding that common methods do not completely eliminate site-specific biases.

* Assessing Multi-Site rs-fMRI-Based Connectomic Harmonization Using Information Theory. *Brain Sciences*, 2022. [LINK](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/9/1219)

**SpaceSur (November 2023 ‚Äì December 2024):**
Development of pipelines to process satellite images. Trained models on public datasets for building segmentation (mAP@0.5: 0.8140) and landfill classification (F1 score: 0.8897). Wrote code to fine-tune models with future new data.

**Practia (July 2022 ‚Äì February 2024):**
Consulting service to guide a novice team in executing deep learning and computer vision projects for the first time. Addressed questions on task approaches and successful model training.

**ECODOC (May 2022 ‚Äì April 2024):**
