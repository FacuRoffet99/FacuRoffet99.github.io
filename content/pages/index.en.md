## üî± About me

Hi, I'm Facu, an electronic engineer who realized that circuits weren't his thing. In a moment of complete serendipity during the pandemic, I came across the YouTube channel [DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/@DotCSV) and almost instantly discovered that my true passion was artificial intelligence (particularly deep learning). So I decided to start learning about it on my own (I can‚Äôt recommend the [FastAI course](https://course.fast.ai/) enough).

Fortunately for my career, the National University of the South (Universidad Nacional del Sur - UNS) has the Image Science Laboratory (Laboratorio de Ciencias de las Im√°genes - LCI), a nationally renowned institution for research, development, and technology transfer in image processing and remote sensing. There I met [Claudio Delrieux](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AdhE2GoAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) (LCI director), who quickly became my mentor and introduced me to [Gustavo Patow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w2kGazcAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao). The three of us outlined a work plan for me to apply to the CONICET Internal Doctoral Scholarship for Strategic Topics. After obtaining it in 2023, I have specialized in using deep learning and brain fMRI data to improve early diagnosis and understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

Beyond my work, I have random interests in other disciplines such as philosophy, geography, and psychology. I‚Äôm a strong advocate of learning for its own sake, not just as a means to an end, so I spend part of my free time watching online courses and taking notes. My notes are primarily designed for my own understanding, but I make them available in the [Course Notes](/en/notes/) section in case they‚Äôre helpful to anyone else.

I'm also a big fan of nature and adventure. Whenever I get the chance, I travel to discover new places‚Äîbe it solo, with friends, family, or folks from the [Club Andino Bah√≠a Blanca](https://www.instagram.com/clubandinobahiablanca/). In the [Summits and trails](/en/summits_and_trails.html) section, I share some pictures from my journeys.

## üè¢ Industry projects

**Viterra (January 2025 ‚Äì April 2025):**
Conceptualization and development of an application that allows operators to automate the quality control process in seed hulling machines, improving measurement consistency and freeing up valuable operational staff time. The application contains a regression model that, based on photographs of seed samples, predicts the percentages of whole seeds (MAE: 1.50) and damaged seeds (MAE: 3.09).

**SpaceSur (November 2023 ‚Äì December 2024):**
Development of pipelines to process satellite images. Trained models on public datasets for building segmentation (mAP@0.5: 0.8140) and landfill classification (F1 score: 0.8897). Deliver of a modular codebase to facilitate and streamline future iterations with customer-specific data.

**Practia (July 2022 ‚Äì February 2024):**
Technical consulting and mentoring. Strategic guidance for a novice team to address and execute their first deep learning projects, shortening their learning curve and ensuring the adoption of best practices.

**ECODOC (May 2022 ‚Äì April 2024):**
Preprocessing and organization of a dataset of more than 3,000 panoramic dental X-ray images. Model training for tooth segmentation (mAP@0.5: 0.9230) and detection of pathologies such as caries (F1 score: 0.8504) and retentions (F1 score: 0.9127), with the goal of subsequently integrating them into an on-demand software service.

## üîç Academic projects and publications

**Doctoral project (April 2023 ‚Äì Present):**
Study and development of deep learning‚Äìbased tools for simulating and predicting whole-brain neuronal activity and its evolution in disease states by defining biomarkers. The goal is for these tools to predict treatment effects and drug responses in neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs, etc.) to contribute to personalized diagnosis.
